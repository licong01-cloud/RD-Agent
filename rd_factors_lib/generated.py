"""Auto-generated factor implementations from RD-Agent evolution.

Phase 2: this module is maintained by RD-Agent tooling (e.g. backfill
or evolution pipelines). Successful factors will be materialised here
as plain Python functions with a stable signature, for example::

    def factor_xxx(df: "pd.DataFrame") -> "pd.Series":
        ...

AIstock MUST treat this module as read-only and use it only as a
reference implementation when aligning its own factor engine.
"""

# NOTE: concrete factor implementations will be appended here by RD-Agent
# tooling. This file is intentionally kept minimal in the initial
# bootstrap so that importing rd_factors_lib.generated is always safe.
